            <!-- PROJECT SHIFT -->
            <h2>Project Shift</h2>
            <p><i>Project Shift</i> is a recent passion project that me and a small group of people are working on. It
                is a rhythm game consisting of 6 lanes but only 4 hittable buttons. To hit notes on other lanes, you
                have to shift your "Bracket," which indicates which 4 lanes you're able to hit. I am the main project
                leader, main programmer, and composer.</p>

            <p><i>Moving On</i> is a senior capstone project that me and 5 other students worked on. For our capstone
                project, we were imposed with many design constraints, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The game must be playable offline, and the total download size must be less than 100mb.</li>
                <li>The game must be completeable using only a single hand, with no auditory information, and with
                    colorblind support.</li>
                <li>Active play can always reach a natural resting point within two minutes without the need to actively
                    pause the game.</li>
                <li>The game must have support for two different languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I was the design
                lead, composer, sound designer, assistant programmer, and assistant artist.</p>

            <p><i>Retro-Active</i> is a first-person 3D platformer that utilizes 2D games to interact and manipulate the
                world. This game was made for a class project for learning Unity. Each team was given a prompt for their
                game, and my team was given the prompt <b>"game within the game"</b>. At the end of class, each team was
                able to vote a game for specific awards, such as "Aesthetic Award" and "Best Trailer".
                <i>Retro-Active</i> won the student award of "Tech Award"! I was the lead level designer,
                environmental artist, and assistant programmer.
