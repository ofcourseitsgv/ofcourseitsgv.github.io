            <p><i>Moving On</i> is a senior capstone project that me and 5 other students worked on. For our capstone
                project, we were imposed with many design constraints, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The game must be playable offline, and the total download size must be less than 100mb.</li>
                <li>The game must be completeable using only a single hand, with no auditory information, and with
                    colorblind support.</li>
                <li>Active play can always reach a natural resting point within two minutes without the need to actively
                    pause the game.</li>
                <li>The game must have support for two different languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I was the design
                lead, composer, sound designer, assistant programmer, and assistant artist.</p>
